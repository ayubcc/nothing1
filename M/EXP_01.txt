                       AIM: To develop a problem statement for applying various software engineering process activities.

Describe idea/current state of affairs:
The current state of affairs for education of underprivileged students is that many bright and talented
children from low-income families are unable to pursue their education due to financial constraints. This
has led to a widening gap in educational opportunities and outcomes, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
While there are various initiatives to promote education for underprivileged students, there is still a
significant need for additional support. A fundraising website for poor student education would provide a
platform for donors to support these students and help them achieve their full potential.
Explain your problem:
The problem that a fundraising website for poor student education aims to address is the financial
barriers that prevent underprivileged students from accessing quality education. Many bright and
talented children from low-income families are unable to pursue their education due to financial
constraints, which has led to a widening gap in educational opportunities and outcomes, perpetuating the
cycle of poverty. Despite various initiatives to promote education for underprivileged students, there is
still a significant need for additional support. A fundraising website for poor student education would
provide a platform for donors to support these students and help them achieve their full potential. The
website would help bridge the gap between donors and students who need financial assistance to
pursue their education.
Backup your assertions:
A fundraising website for poor student education would provide an opportunity for donors to give back to
their community by supporting underprivileged students who are unable to pursue their education due to
financial constraints. By donating to this cause, donors would be helping to bridge the gap in educational
opportunities and outcomes, which would ultimately lead to a more equitable society. Additionally,
supporting education for underprivileged students would help break the cycle of poverty, as education is
one of the most effective tools for social and economic mobility. By giving back through a fundraising
website for poor student education, donors would be making a meaningful and lasting impact on the lives
of these students and their communities.
Propose your solution:
A fundraising website for poor student education would provide a platform for donors to support
underprivileged students who are unable to pursue their education due to financial constraints. The
website would allow students to create profiles and share their stories, needs, and goals with potential
donors. Donors would be able to browse through profiles and select the students they would like to
support. The website would also provide a secure and transparent payment system, as well as tools for
tracking the progress of the students they support. Additionally, the website could partner with schools
and non-profit organizations to identify students who are most in need of financial assistance and ensure
that the funds are used effectively. By providing a convenient and transparent way for donors to support
underprivileged students, a fundraising website for poor student education would help bridge the gap in
educational opportunities and outcomes, and ultimately lead to a more equitable society.
Explain the benefits of solution:
1. Increased access to education: The website would help underprivileged students gain access to
quality education that they may not have been able to afford otherwise.
2. Bridging the gap in educational opportunities and outcomes: By providing financial assistance to
underprivileged students, the website would help bridge the gap in educational opportunities and
outcomes, which would lead to a more equitable society.
3. Breaking the cycle of poverty: Education is one of the most effective tools for social and economic
mobility, and supporting education for underprivileged students would help break the cycle of poverty.
4. Convenience and transparency for donors: The website would provide a convenient and transparent
way for donors to support underprivileged students, with tools for tracking the progress of the students
they support.
5. Collaboration with schools and non-profit organizations: The website could partner with schools and
non-profit organizations to identify students who are most in need of financial assistance and ensure that

the funds are used effectively.
