                                         AIM: TO APPLY TRADITIONAL PROCESS MODEL FOR THE SELECTED CASE STUDY.
                                                                        
THEORY:
RAD is a linear sequential software development process model that emphasizes a
concise development cycle using an element based construction approach. If the
requirements are well understood and described, and the project scope is a constraint,
the RAD process enables a development team to create a fully functional system within
a concise time period.
RAD (Rapid Application Development) is a concept that products can be developed faster and of higher quality
through:
• Gathering requirements using workshops or focus groups
• Prototyping and early, reiterative user testing of designs
• The re-use of software components
• A rigidly paced schedule that refers design improvements to the next product version
• Less formality in reviews and other team communication
The various phases of RAD are as follows:
1.Business Modelling: The information flow among business functions is defined by answering questions like
what data drives the business process, what data is generated, who generates it, where does the information go,
who process it and so on.
2. Data Modelling: The data collected from business modeling is refined into a set of data objects (entities) that
are needed to support the business. The attributes (character of each entity) are identified, and the relation
between these data objects (entities) is defined.
Process Modelling: The information object defined in the data modeling phase are transformed to achieve the
data flow necessary to implement a business function. Processing descriptions are created for adding, modifying,
deleting, or retrieving a data object.
4. Application Generation: Automated tools are used to facilitate construction of the software; even they use
the 4th GL techniques.
5. Testing & Turnover: Many of the programming components have already been tested since RAD emphasis
reuse. This reduces the overall testing time. But the new part must be tested, and all interfaces must be fully
exercised.

ADVANTAGES OF RAD MODEL:
• In this model, changes are adoptable.
• Each phase in RAD brings highest priority functionality to the customer.
• It reduced development time.
• It increases the reusability of features.
• This model is flexible for change.

DISADVANTAGE OF OF RAD MODEL:
• It required highly skilled designers.
• All application is not compatible with RAD.
• For smaller projects, we cannot use the RAD model.
• On the high technical risk, it's not suitable.
• Required user involvement.

SUITABILITY JUSTIFICATION:
1. Quick Development: RAD focuses on rapid prototyping and iterative development,
allowing for faster delivery of working software. In the case of a fundraising website,
where time-to-market is essential, RAD can help in quickly building and deploying
essential features to start collecting donations.
2. User Involvement: RAD encourages frequent user involvement and feedback during the development
process. In the context of a fundraising website, this is beneficial as it allows fundraisers and donors to
actively participate in shaping the platform and ensuring that it meets their specific needs and
expectations.
3. Flexible and Adaptable: The fundraising landscape can be dynamic, and requirements may change as the
platform evolves or as new fundraising trends emerge. The RAD model's iterative approach enables the
website to adapt to these changes more easily, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement.
4. Reduced Development Cost: RAD's focus on reusability of components and faster development cycles
can lead to cost savings. For fundraising websites, especially if they are for non-profit organizations or
startups with limited budgets, cost-effectiveness can be a crucial factor.
5. High-Quality Output: RAD emphasizes the use of prototypes and iterative testing, which helps in

identifying and resolving issues early in the development process. This approach can lead to a higher-
quality final product for the fundraising website.

6. Collaborative Development: RAD promotes close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and
end-users. For a fundraising website, this collaborative approach can help ensure that the platform aligns
with the organization's mission, values, and goals.
7. Time-Bound Projects: RAD is well-suited for time-bound projects, where there is a need to deliver the
product within a tight schedule. Many fundraising campaigns are time-sensitive, and RAD's rapid
development approach can cater to these time constraints effectively.
PROCEDURE:
Step 1: Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
• Define the project scope, objectives, and target audience for the fundraising website.
• Identify the key features and functionalities required, such as user registration, campaign creation,
donation processing, social sharing, etc.
• Gather requirements through workshops, interviews, and surveys involving stakeholders, fundraisers,
donors, and potential users.
Step 2: Quick Design and Prototyping
• Create a high-level design and wireframes for the website's main pages and functionalities.
• Develop rapid prototypes using RAD tools or web development frameworks to demonstrate the basic flow
and user interactions.
• Share the prototypes with stakeholders and gather feedback to iterate and refine the design.
Step 3: Data Modeling and Backend Development

• Design the database schema to store user information, fundraising campaigns, donations, and other
relevant data.
• Set up the backend infrastructure, including server configuration and database connectivity.
• Implement the core functionalities of user registration, login, and basic profile creation.
Step 4: Incremental Development of Features
• Divide the website development into smaller increments, focusing on a few features in each iteration.
• Develop and integrate features like campaign creation, campaign listing, donation processing, social media
sharing, and notifications.
• Test each increment thoroughly to ensure functionality and usability.
Step 5: User Feedback and Iteration
• Launch the website in a limited capacity to a group of real users, such as fundraisers and donors.
• Collect feedback through user surveys, feedback forms, or interviews.
• Analyze the feedback and identify areas for improvement and enhancement.
Step 6: Continuous Integration and Deployment
• Continuously integrate new features and improvements into the website.
• Deploy the updates in short iterations, ensuring a rapid and seamless deployment process.
Step 7: Security and Quality Assurance
• Implement security measures to protect user data, especially payment-related information.
• Conduct rigorous quality assurance and testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Step 8: Monitoring and Maintenance
• Monitor the website's performance, traffic, and user interactions regularly.
• Address any issues or bottlenecks promptly to ensure smooth operation.
• Provide ongoing maintenance and support to keep the website running effectively.
Step 9: Scaling and Expansion
• As the fundraising website gains popularity and traction, be prepared to scale the infrastructure and
resources to accommodate increased traffic and usage.

OUTPUT:
1. User Registration and Login: Users can register on the website, create accounts, and log in using their
credentials.
2. User Profiles: Each user will have a profile page where they can add information, profile pictures, and
view their fundraising activities.
3. Campaign Creation: Fundraisers can create campaigns with details about their cause, fundraising goals,
and target amounts.
